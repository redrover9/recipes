* `10 oz` all purpose flour
* `1 tsp` baking powder
* `1/2 tsp` baking soda
* `1 tsp` kosher salt
* `1 tbsp` sugar

> Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk until homogenous.

---

* `2` eggs, separated
* `1 1/2 cups` buttermilk (or 1 cup of yogurt whisked with 1/3 cup, 2 tbsp and 2 tsp of milk)
* `1 cup` sour cream (or yogurt)
* `4 tbsp` unsalted butter, melted

> Place dry mix in a large bowl. In a medium clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks, buttermilk, and sour cream until homogenous. Slowly drizzle in the melted butter while whisking. Carefully fold in the egg whites with a rubber spatula until just combined. Pour the mixture over the dry mix and fold until just combined (there should still be plenty of lumps).

> Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes. Add a small amount of butter or oil to the griddle and spread with a paper towel until no visible butter or oil remains. Use a 1⁄4-cup dry measure to place 4 pancakes in the skillet and cook until bubbles start to appear on top and the bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip the pancakes and cook on the second side until golden brown and completely set, about 2 minutes longer.

> Serve the pancakes immediately, or keep warm on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet in a warm oven while you cook the remaining 3 batches.
